* Data is a collection of information,it is of three types string,number and  boolean
* String is that any value inside braces is a string like "joz" .Number is used to save numserical datatype. Boolean is used to compare and explain true are false
* I learned the primitive data types and data structures.
* Composite Datatypes: Combination of one or more types is called the composite data type.

* Data structures: collection of data arrange like tree. Structure depends on how to write a code.Array is collection of objects. ex Library: Bookshelf,Reading Area.Data Encapsulation: Data binds code together is called Data encapsulation. Ex Switches has on,off and actions turn on and off. Combination of both action and operations is called Data Encapsulation.

* Novalue means that it can be explained as Null,undefined and void .Null is the value we are going to give ,undefined is somthing that there is a mistake in the given statement.

* In a program there is only 4 options creating, updateing, reading and deletion. object has key and value.that means ex object key:value. The second type of datatype we use is array .Array uses square brakets.
* Algorithm varries based on the structure of the program.
