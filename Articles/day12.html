<p> I learned that to define pattern or a word space are used. Every word has seperate meaning so there should space in between them . our mind takes the word by having spaces "i am joshua" if it is in another pattern like "i#am#joshua"
the computer abserves that '#' as space and read the sentance ina proper way.<p>
