# Day3
* Today i started my day by starting to revise about the day1 and day2 topics
* Then i tried to install gui to my laptop there was some error and i was unable to install the gui
* Then the mentors tried to help with it but the laptop was with some virus
* so they gave me another laptop and helped to install gui by using different command in the terminal
* At that time of the installation i got some free time
* i went to the person who are working in the surfboard and asked some information to build some knowledge
* Then aswin told me read some books to gain more information and how to train myself as a best learner
*then i read some book ,then i got some knowledge about how to learn and train my mind to work and perform in the works which i should do to gain knowledge and perform good as the workers of core illustrio
* I learned that if i study or work in a process ,i should have interest in that i should do or solve the problem without regreting it .I should learn it myself or get some help from the mentors to improve my own knowlege. I should to the job that is given to me as it is given to me by the mentors and i should complete it,I should do that problem and find a solution for that problem for my own to gain of knowledge
* after completion of installing GUI i started to right the first days assignment again,it helped me to revise the day 1 topics
* Day3 topic was taken by the mentor ,at first he said about engineering subjects that every subject is like a language we should unserstand it,every subjects say the same thing 
*Then he gave as a problem to solve called allian lock problem,there were some constraints in the problem i tried to figure out the solution
* I tried to solve  the problem for long time but i didnt understand the question so i couldnt able to  solve the problem then the mentor explained the solution of the problem 
*The solution of the problem was very simple ,the way we solved farmer ,fox,goose and corn problem 
*I came to know from this problem solving is, if the if the question of the problem is understanded correctly the problem can be solved easily
* so if your solving a problem first understand the problem then try to solve the problem
*Then the mentor gave as another problem to solve
