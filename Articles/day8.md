* I have learned about the algorithm of a problem .That is in a machine we should find a number  by using only store and count for example if there is two numbers 6 and 4 and it has an constraint that it can only count and store if anything is possible how?

* Algorithm
 -step 1  :start  the problem
 -step 2  :store a value and b value and store c as 0
 -step 3  :count a value and c value until the c value and b value are equal then the value will be the needed value 	
 -step 4  :stop the program

* constraints
 - we can store the value
 - we can count the value no other options is available
