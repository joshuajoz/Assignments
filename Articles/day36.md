# Day36

* I have learned that the concepts of flutter and how to work in flutter. Then i tried to install flutter app first and andriod studio to build the app.In my computer it was not working then i worked in it to coorect it it and tried to solve the problem ,however i finally found the problem by understanding it my system was not enabled to install the app so i enabled it by switching off my lap.and changed the setting.
* I worked in the files of the main.dart and import all the packages into main dart file by calling the file names.
* void main() is the main function to run the dart file without the main it wont work .main function is the main property of the dart.
* runApp() in this the app we are going ti difine inside the run app is a class.runApp will does run the class of myapp.
* In class ,the app we are going to create build the context. So we can use a function as class app extends statelessWidget
* In the widget build the context as Widget build(). 
* Body is the content to create buttons,Textfields,Text colors,text alignment,Text styles,margin,onTap and Splashcolor.
* Alignment means align the text in the center,center left,top and bottom left rights. Margin will set the limit of the content to display in the screen. onTap is when we tap an button or text it will redirects to another page. splash means blinking the field like on and off continously or doing some effects in the app which we are going to create.

8.save it in terminal and change directory to project name and type command as flutter run 9.It will run the app and show the output in android virtual manager. 10. when we made some changes in the dart file,after when we press hot reload it will changes the output within second.

In figma designing the app we created using flexbox.

flexbox is Rows and columns.

In figma app designed with boxes main box is known as container.Inside columns and childrens are present.
