* I have learned that binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.binary search is used to quickly find a value in a sorted sequence.
* I have learned about merge sort that it first divide the list into the smallest unit that means 1 element, then compare each element with the adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent list.
* In Quick sort is a fast sorting algorithm used to sort a list of elements. The list is divided into two partitions such that all elements to the left of pivot are smaller than the pivot and all elements to the right of pivot are greater than or equal to the pivot.pivot means centre of an array.
* Then i have learned more about javascript hoe to divide array and how to calculate in it.
