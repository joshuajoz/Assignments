## Day16

# What i learned from the intern

* I learned the basic fundamental skills
	 - Reading
         - writing
         - mathemetical thinking
         - problem solving
         - Researching
         - Breaking down and synthesysing
         - Typing
         - Creativity
* I have learned to work in a terminal ,a terminal is the method that is similar to the normal method of our own basic computer but we have to do every works in a keyword mechanism
 * I have learned some basic commands that are used in a terminal and that are ls,mkdir ,cd ,cd .. ,touch ,clear these are some of the important commands in the terminal which i have learned
 * create a file by using touch open it and open the file by using vi , after opening there are some commands used to work inside the text editer.They are Esc,i,:w,:q,:wq,:u,cntrl+r,dd,G,gg

* I have learned about mathemetical thinking and problem solving,I learned that in problem solving first we should understand the problem and we should not give up on the problem. I have learned how to create a repository in a git hub ,and how to link the github with the terminal 

* I have learned that there is a criteria for software engineer that if the problem is solved all the constraints should be met and the solution should be formalised. There are three different types of problem
        - Scalability problem
        - Resource constraints problem
        - Domain problem

* I have learned that from a hamiltanion path method each node should be attached with a single edge and all the nodes should be connected

* In eulers graph theory ,if there is a problem and the problem has no solution that can be explained using eulers theory that the problem has no solution using it.

* I learned that computer is that it can compute it calculate
* I learned about the evolution of computer,that are mechanical, electrical, electronic and quantum.
* I learned about problem solving using different methods to improve my skills in improving my knowlege
* I learned about languages ,every languages has space and punchvations to represent a word and each word has seperate meaning . If there is no space in between the meaning of the word may change ,so that space are used to give a word seperate meaning.
* More problem solving about the multiplication using algorithm .

# presentation

* The presentation should clear to people who are listening
* Presentation can be small but the summary and the key points to present should be clear
* Smile and Make Eye Contact with your Audience
* start strongly
