# Day28

* I have learned that a statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement to be executed in the loop.  Then i learned about shift and unshift,In shift()  method it removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array. In The unshift() method it adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
* Then by using this i have learned to solve the problem the tower of hanoi,by solving tower of hanoi we can learn more about the javascript by solving the program.
* The algorithm i learned today was,

	 - Get the no.of disks.
  	 - Find no.of steps with Math.pow(2,a.length).
	 - Check if the no.of disks is even.
	 - Move discs between 1.A & B 2.A & C 3.B & C
	 - if check no.of moves is less than steps.
	 - Else check if no.of disks is odd.
	 - Move discs between 1.A & C 2.A & B 3.B & C
	 - Check if no.of steps is less than steps.
	 - Stop
