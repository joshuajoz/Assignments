* The scope that is always available onle inside a block is called the scope block
* I learnt about User Interface :Design,frames and figma framework basics. Everything is boxes in creating interface in applications.
User Interface: User interface is which we interact and see in a computer or devices . Based on our project we designed the App layouts. By using figma we can create any type of layouts. In figma,rectangle is the only shape to design the layouts. By edge of rectangle only can drag to form a circle.

* In dribbble website there were lot of layouts we can get more ideas for our project using that website. First step is make an layout with boxes as main footer and title navigator,bottom footer. After the boxes created start the code it will match to the layout. Blocks can be created using rows and columns.

* In scope I learnt about working of function , execution of function. I have learned how the working block of main function gives the value to every function and how it defined.
