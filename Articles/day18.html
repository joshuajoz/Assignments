<h2> Intern </h2>

<p> If there is a problem or a question it will have constraints</p>
<p> Data is a collection of information.this can be useful for creating algorithm.',"  are used to represent a string. variable are used to store value.</p>
<p> Then i have learned about token iser, lexical analysis,syntactic analysis and sematic analysis.In a computer language these are used to check the lanuage are the given input is correct or error.</p>
<ul>
<li> Token iser is that the given input will break into block.</li>
<li> lexical analysis check that each tokens have a meaning.</li>
<li> Syntactic analysis check the syntex and structure of input</li>
<li> Sematic analysis check the meaning of the whole block </li>
</ul>
<p> For example if we are typing print " hello" in c language the input we give will go to the token iser and it will print error because print is not a keywords in c lanuage it is used in some other language like python.</p>
