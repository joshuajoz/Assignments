* I worked in the files of the main.dart and import all the packages into main dart file by calling the file names.
* void main() is the main function to run the dart file without the main it wont work .main function is the main property of the dart.
* runApp() in this the app we are going ti difine inside the run app is a class.runApp will does run the class of myapp.
* In class ,the app we are going to create build the context. So we can use a function as class app extends statelessWidget
* In the widget build the context as Widget build(). 
* Body is the content to create buttons,Textfields,Text colors,text alignment,Text styles,margin,onTap and Splashcolor.
* Alignment means align the text in the center,center left,top and bottom left rights. Margin will set the limit of the content to display in the screen. onTap is when we tap an button or text it will redirects to another page. splash means blinking the field like on and off continously or doing some effects in the app which we are going to create.
