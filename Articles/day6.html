<h1>Day 6</h1>
	I have learned that a computer is something that computes , calculates and used to store and processing data. If we give a value as input it process and give the output.

<h1>Evolution of computer</h1>

	<p>I have learned that the evolution of computers has four stage</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Mechanical</li>
	<li>Electrical</li>
	<li>Electronic</li>
	<li> Quantum</li>
	</ul>
<p> I have understood that the first generation of computer was very difficult to operate and work in it. those old mechanical computers were very big and it will be hard to operate. In that kind of computers the manual work does or takes more time and the process of the mechanical</p>
<p>Then the second generation  of computers is the electrical  its like a circuit form ,it has only alpha beta as the answer, it has only on off mechanism.It uses 0 and 1 binary values moreover the message typed into a computer is converted into binary because its the language of the computer</p>
<p>Then i learned about the third generation of computer is that electronic uses microprocesser, a micro processer is a computer processer .it is a small number of integrated circuit</p>
<p>The heart of every chips is called transmitter. A diode is somthing that its contain both anode and cathode. The process in a computer are done at clock speed</p>
<p>Character sets are of two types</p>
	<ol>
 	<li>ASCII</li>
	<li>unicode</li>
	</ol>
<p>ASCII this is used in less powerful computer to represent textual data like letters numbers and non input device like control characters</p>
<p>Unicode It is something that emojis and text are used in a unicode to develop and its famous in this world. It has some sub process that are utf-8,utf -16 and utf-32</p>
	<ol>
	<li> UTF-8 is the most popular type of unicode encodeing uses one bytes for words</li>
	<li>UTF-16 is that it uses a two bytes for 65536</li>
	<li> UTF-32 is a multibyte encoding that represent each type with four bytes</li>
	</ol>
<p>I learned that quantum computers are more advance than the normal computer .Quantum computer use the properties of quantum physics.</p>

<h2>Number system</h2>
<p> A number is system is that representing the numbers of a given set in a digit or symbols.A number system contains unary, binary, decimal number and babylonion number. unary nymber are represented in I,II,III,IV,V and etc.binary numbers are the combination of 1 and 0.Decimal numbers are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 etc.Babylonion number has base60.So from this i learned that basically the number system are based on counting. An example is given and i learned from that problem is that if there is machine without given an information the counting process is done by using store and count these things will be builtin inside the machine . so if we get a limited set of information we need certain problem solving method or problem solving mind ,so that we can ADD,SUB etc by using "store" and "count" to built the machine that is with no information</p>
<p> Arrangment of operation is called algorithm. An algorithm started and completed by using start and stop. And finally in end of day if a problem is solved then there is some steps involved in it to solve the problem ,If its not then the problem will not have any solution .We need problem solving mind and building words to write down the algorithm as a skill to improve our problem solving mind</p>
