* I have learned about the minutes of meeting and what are the things that will happen in a minutes of meeting.the things that are to be done and the work that are in progress and the things that should be done are discussed in it.

* Then i have learned about function Return- The return statement is used in function and it will stop executing and it will return  . for example
	function add(a,b){
   	 return a+b;}
* Break- The break statement is used to break the current looping and it will print the value.
* Switch- The switch statement is used to create a different conditional statements and used to compare the cases.
* Continue -Its the functions that loops infinite times and need to stop it with condition.
