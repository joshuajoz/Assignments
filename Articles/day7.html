<h1>Day7</h1>
<p> I have learned that there are five generation of computer</p>
<ul>
<li>First generation -vaccume tube technology is used in this for calculation.They are big in size and weight.After storing a data in place it is very hard to transfer </li>
<li>second generation-Transisters are used .It improve the speed and performance.Decreased the consumption of electricity.magnetic tapes were used to store data</li>
<li>Third generation-Integrated circuits were used. It consist of many transmitters mounted on chips thes are called the semiconductors</li>
<li>Fourth generation-This used thousands of integrated circuit equals to millions of transmiters and brought the whole central processing unit into a small chip is called microprocesser</li>
<li>Fifth generation-It is artificial intelligence made to think like human being</li>
</ul>
<h2>git</h2>
<p>I learned how to work in a one git and have access to contribute the datas by sharing git pull and git push by giving access to the contributer .for example we created a new file sent a message using that as "hello" and pushed that file to the git by my mentor and ilearned how to pull that message into my terminal and recreate the message and rename the folder and send some other message and pushed it to the github.In this i learned to push and pull in the git and send message and share information in asame git by 2 peoples</p>
<h1>Problem solving</h1>
<p>I have learned that a problem solving mind is very important.A problem solving mind solves a problem easily.so we should train our mind.There were three different problems given to as in that the problem has many solution but we should have a perfect solution with a possible way to solve the problem and we should explain the constraints for those problems.</p>
<p>The first problem was harry potter problem that he is having galleon,sickles and knuts 1 sickles is 29 knuts and 1 galleon is 17 sickles .And he should buy a 25 galean broomstick.I learned that we should find the constraints and understand the question and we noted the constraints </p>
<h3>algorithm</h3>
<ul>
<li>step1- start</li>
<li>step2- convert sickles into galleon by division</li>
<li>step3- convert knuts into sickles by division</li>
<li>step4- convert sickles which got from the knuts into galleon by division</li>
<li>step5- Add the values of sickles and knuts galleon value</li>
<li>step6- sub the galleon value of knuts with the broomsticks value</li>
<li>step7- multiply the remaining value the sickles value of galleon</li>
<li>step8- stop</li>
</ul>

<p> The second problem was table puzzle problem ,there are 6 different values for cost ,seating and size</p>
<h3>algorithm</h3>
<ul>
<li>step1-start the problem</li>
<li>step2-store all the values of cost in ascending order</li>
<li>step3-store all the seatings values in decending order</li>
<li>step4-store all the size values in ascending order </li>
<li>step5-comparing both the given table and the table we solved there will be only one value similar </li>
<li>step6-take that values </li>
<li>step7-the only similar value will be the taken value after changing all the values in acending and decending order</li>
<li>step8-stop</li>
</ul>

<p> The third problem was tom and cherry the tom should find the shortest path to reach jerry<p>
<ul>
<li>step1- start the problem</li>
<li>step2- store all the distance value</li>
<li>step3- store all the routes from tom to jerry</li>
<li>step4- find the shortest path of all the stored routes</li>
<li>step5- stop </li>
</ul>
