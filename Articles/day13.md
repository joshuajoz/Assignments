* I have learned about the process of how to search and do a work .I have done search in a topic of how to install browser to linux centos and the process involved in it to search and do the installation
* I have learned to write a neat algorithm for the things that we do .For example,to take a cup of coffee there are some steps involved 
	- step1: get down of chair
	- step2: search for the coffee machine
	- step3: go to the coffee machine
	- step4: search for the cups
	- step5: take a fresh cup
	- step6: keep the fresh cup under the tea valve
	- step7: press the tea button
	- step8: wait until the tea is filled
	- step9: take the filled cup of tea 
	- step10: drink the tea
These re steps involved for a cup tea or coffee like this the problem solving should have a answer that should be easily understandable to give a solution for a problem
