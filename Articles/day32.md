# Day32

* I have learned about dart by comparing to javascript,moreover all language are similar to each other Dart and javascript are almost the same .In Dart main() function should be defined otherwise the program wont work.
* In java script we use "number, string, array, console.log" instead of this in dart we are using "int, string, list, print".

* Then i have learned about ascii values,that are usec represent binary values,
i used that in a program to print a set of number .That is we need to print A-z.so i learned about ASCII.how i done the program is 
  For example
 let a=64
 For(i=0;i<26;i++)
 {
 console.log(String.fromCharCode(a+i)
 }

This is the program i have done to work in ascii to print the alphabets from a-z
