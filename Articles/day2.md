#Day2
* I learned more about problem solving
* I learned that in problem solving first we should understand the problem and we should not give up on the problem
* I in problem solving i learned that there are some constraints  ,so i should find the constraints first, then i should list all the possible operation then arrange the operation to form a solution
 we have given a problem from the mentor ,i understand from the problem is that the problems may be difficult or easy but mathametically thinking helps us to get the answer easily
* For example in a problem of 1-35 numbers we should find all the numbers in a order that by adding each number there should be square rrot for those both numbers like 1 3 6 in this 1+3 is 4 its a square number then 3+6 is 9 its also a square number ,Its posible to solve the problem in mathametical thinking
	 Then there was another problem a puzzle thats with mixed combination of numbers from 1-8 i understood that problem by different method then by understanding the mathametical thinking  it can be solved easily by train method 

##github
* I learned some ways in  the github ,At first i learned how to create an account in the github, create a github by using www.github.com
