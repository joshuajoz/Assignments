<h1>Day4</h1>
<h2>eulers graph theory</h2>
<p>I learned different things in day4 session, there  are some problems that cant be solved that can be solved by eulers graph theory .i learned that if there is an unsolvable problem that can be done by eulers theorem for example take four different places a b c and d that are connected by bridgesthrough a there are three bridges and through  c there are three bridges b has five bridges and d has three bridges.first i worked to go through every bridges only once ut its not possible to move through then by using eulers theorem through node b i shall move through it more then once</p>
<h2>hamilton theory</h2>
<p>I observed that in a hamilton theory there will be a solution very easy ,an example for an hamilton theory is that each node should have only one edge ,for an cubiod there will be eight nodes that every nodes should be attached to the each node at a single step</p>
<h2>markup lanuage</h2>
<p> there are different markup lanuage that were teached in the class ,the things i understood was ,</p>

<li>xml</li>
<li>html</li>
<li>yaml</li>
