* I have learned array can store values of any primitive data type, so an arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays. Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
* There are different methods in an Array-
 1.push():It will add the value at end of the array.
 2.shift():It will Delete the value at first value of the array.
 3.pop():It will delete the last value in the array.
 4.unshift():It will add the value at start of the array.
* Then i have learned some programs in a javascript
