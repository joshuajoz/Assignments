# I have learned about internet
 
* An internet is a  is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol .The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s .The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world. Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection. The Internet today comprises hundreds of thousands of local area networks (LANs) worldwide, interconnected by a backbone wide area network (WAN). LANs typically operate at rates of 10 to 100 Mbps.Some examples include: Web – a collection of billions of webpages that you can view with a web browser. Email – the most common method of sending and receiving messages online. Social media – websites and apps that allow people to share comments, photos, and videos. INTERNET is a short form of Interconnected Network of all the Web Servers Worldwide. It is also called the World Wide Web or simply the Web. It knows no boundary but brings huge economic chances for people in every country. 
* Then i learned how the internet started ,Early 1960 during cold war of Russia and America. American wanted to communicate with Armed Forces. A network of four computers was developed in the beginning,On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” communication from one computer to another. (The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA and the second was at Stanford; each one was the size of a small house.) The message—“LOGIN”—was short and simple, but it crashed the fledgling ARPA network anyway: The Stanford computer only received the note’s first two letters.By the end of the 1970s, a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf had begun to solve this problem by developing a way for all of the computers on all of the world’s mini-networks to communicate with one another. He called his invention “Transmission Control Protocol,” or TCP.

* Then i learned about how internet works,Internet is a global computer network for communication.Everything we use internet like medical industries, games, chats ,movies, online shopping works in internet.
90% of internet come through cables.
* It has three different tiers, - Tier1,Tier2,Tier3
Tier1 - using ocean fibre optics to connect continent to continent.
Tier2 - ISP means Internet Service Provider, like Airtel and BSNL.
Tier3 - local stations
* Why Internet costs money eg.tier1,tier2...needs to do their process of maintaining the cables and signals so they cost money.

# Minutes of meating

* Then i have learned that how a meeting will be done in the office todo works and the works done are represented by the peoples working in the office in the meeting.Then they said what are the things they should do this week and the errors to be corrected, bugs should be corrected and they should learn more about other programs ,and subit every as in time .

# Tower of hanoi

 I Tried to solve a problem tower of hanoi ,i have learned the steps ivolved to solve the problem ,how or the ways to solve the tower of hanoi problem.
* The algorithm and constraints are ,
* Constraints
 
   - Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time.
   - Only the "top" disk can be removed.
   - No large disk can sit over a small disk.
* Algorithm
 To write an algorithm for Tower of Hanoi, first we need to learn how to solve this problem with lesser amount of disks, say → 1 or 2. We mark three towers with name, source, destination and aux (only to help moving the disks). If we have only one disk, then it can easily be moved from source to destination peg.

If we have 2 disks −

   - First, we move the smaller (top) disk to aux peg.
   - Then, we move the larger (bottom) disk to destination peg.
   - And finally, we move the smaller disk from aux to destination peg.

* I have learned that a statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement to be executed in the loop.  Then i learned about shift and unshift,In shift()  method it removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array. In The unshift() method it adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
* Then i tried to solve the problem using the steps we learned by using odd and even numbers,
	 - Get the no.of disks.
  	 - Find no.of steps with Math.pow(2,a.length).
	 - Check if the no.of disks is even.
	 - Move discs between 1.A & B 2.A & C 3.B & C
	 - if check no.of moves is less than steps.
	 - Else check if no.of disks is odd.
	 - Move discs between 1.A & C 2.A & B 3.B & C
	 - Check if no.of steps is less than steps.
	 - Stop.
