# Day1

*I learned that computer is that it can compute it calculate ,used to store and process data.If we give an input it process and gives us the output
*I learned about the evolution of computer,that are mechanical, electrical, electronic and quantum.Mechanical is the first generation of computer,it was very difficult to work and operate it. Those computers where very big in size and weight it take more time to process.Then the second generation  of computers is the electrical  its like a circuit form ,it has only alpha beta as the answer, it has only on off mechanism.It uses 0 and 1 binary values moreover the message typed into a computer is converted into binary because its the language of the computer Then i learned about the third generation of computer is that electronic uses microprocesser, a micro processer is a computer processer .it is a small number of integrated circuit.I learned that quantum computers are more advance than the normal computer .Quantum computer use the properties of quantum physics.
* A number system is that representing the numbers of a given set in a digit or symbols.A number system contains unary, binary, decimal number and babylonion number.

# Day2

* I have learned that a problem solving mind is very important.A problem solving mind solves a problem easily.so we should train our mind.
*I have learned that there are five generation of computer.First generation -vaccume tube technology is used in this for calculation.They are big in size and weight.After storing a data in place it is very hard to transfer.second generation-Transisters are used .It improve the speed and performance.Decreased the consumption of electricity.magnetic tapes were used to store the data.hird generation-Integrated circuits were used. It consist of many transmitters mounted on chips thes are called the semiconductors.Fourth generation-This used thousands of integrated circuit equals to millions of transmiters and brought the whole central processing unit into a small chip is called microprocesser.Fifth generation-It is artificial intelligence made to think like human being.

# Day3

* I have learned about the algorithm of a problem.if a problem is solved may be adding 4+4 is 8 in our mind may be easy but the process done by our mind is the algorithm that is the main way to understand and train our mind solve a problem that is said as the mathametical thinking and problem solving .there are many constraints in a problem we should find the constraints and then solve the problemand the steps involved in the process of solving problem is called algorithm.

# Day4

* I learned some skills today about how to solve a problem that problem maybe difficult or easy that may have some difficult problems within it .we should solve the problem by mathematical thinking.I learned how to train my mind to write any essay using html I leaned about the features of whatsapp about how they built and what are the purposes of whatsapp.
* In cultural talks,i learned about resposibilty and obligation the difference between them and some examples for that an responsibility is something that a person willing to do it and the interest that they give for that work to do .obligation is somthing that a person who do his work are something that has been given to him as omg this work is given to me in office and i have to do it are i will be eliminated from the work or something  that a person doing a work withot any respect or responsibilty to it.

# Day5

* I have learned how to improve my knowlege in working as a software engineers from the help of my mentors .
