# Day2

  * I have learned about mathemetical thinking and problem solving,I learned that in problem solving first we should understand the problem and we should not give up on the problem.I in problem solving i learned that there are some constraints  ,so i should find the constraints first, then i should list all the possible operation then arrange the operation to form a solution
  * I have learned how to create a repository in a git hub ,and how to link the github with the terminal .There are some commands that can be used in github to do different works,these are the information i have learned in day 2

# Day3

 * I have learned that there is a criteria for software engineer that if the problem is solved all the constraints should be met and the solution should be formalised
 * there are three different types of problem 
	- Scalability problem 
	- Resource constraints problem
	- Domain problem

# Day4 

 * On this day i have learned more about the mathemetical thinking and problem solving . There are some problems that can be solved and there are some problem that cant be solved ,at first we sholud understand the question clearly to solve the problem
 * If a problem is unsolvable then the problem can be solved by using eulers graph theory
 * I have learned that from a hamiltanion path method each node should be attached with a single edge and all the nodes should be connected
 * There are different  type of markup yaml, html,xml .In html the "h1" is used to denote headings and "h1/" to close the heading it will be presented only if the file is opened and closed like thid for evrey tags like "p" for para,"ul" for unordered list ,"u" for ordered list,"li" for list the items
