# Week7

Minutes of meeting

* I have learned about the minutes of meeting and what are the things that will happen in a minutes of meeting.the things that are to be done and the work that are in progress and the things that should be done are discussed in it.

Function

* Then i have learned about function Return- The return statement is used in function and it will stop executing and it will return  . for example
	function add(a,b){
   	 return a+b;}
* Break- The break statement is used to break the current looping and it will print the value.
* Switch- The switch statement is used to create a different conditional statements and used to compare the cases.
* Continue -Its the functions that loops infinite times and need to stop it with condition.

* Then in function i have laerned about the scope of the functions, I have learned the Scope of block  and the scope of block will works and execute stack functions.Than i learned that in a function there will be a return type that will be int or let like that and some parameter and function body .And in a function can be difined only inside the function ,if it is defined outside than it wont execute the value orerror will be shown.
* The scope that is always available only inside a block is called the scope block.

* In scope I learnt about working of function , execution of function. I have learned how the working block of main function gives the value to every function and how it defined.  

Programming lanuages

* I have learned about dart by comparing to javascript,moreover all language are similar to each other Dart and javascript are almost the same .In Dart main() function should be defined otherwise the program wont work.
* In java script we use "number, string, array, console.log" instead of this in dart we are using "int, string, list, print".

* Then i have learned about ascii values,that are usec represent binary values,
i used that in a program to print a set of number .That is we need to print A-z.so i learned about ASCII.how i done the program is 
  For example
 let a=64
 For(i=0;i<26;i++)
 {
 console.log(String.fromCharCode(a+i)
 }

This is the program i have done to work in ascii to print the alphabets from a-z.

User Interface of apps

*  I learnt about User Interface :Design,frames and figma framework basics. Everything is boxes in creating interface in applications.
User Interface: User interface is which we interact and see in a computer or devices . Based on our project we designed the App layouts. By using figma we can create any type of layouts. In figma,rectangle is the only shape to design the layouts. By edge of rectangle only can drag to form a circle. In dribbble website there were lot of layouts we can get more ideas for our project using that website. First step is make an layout with boxes as main footer and title navigator,bottom footer. After the boxes created start the code it will match to the layout. Blocks can be created using rows and columns.
* I have learned the basic designing process in figma and then i installed figma. In figma i trained myself to do the basic designing of the pages for an application. First basic thing that our team planned the designs in the rough paper and we added the buttons and pages in it. Then i tried to do design part of the given project ,the Main page should be designed as logo and then navigate to another page as signin page.In signin page has three boxes for Username,Password and Forgot password.
