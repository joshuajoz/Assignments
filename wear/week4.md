## week4

What i learned from the intern

* I learned the basic fundamental skills. I have learned about mathemetical thinking and problem solving,I learned that in problem solving first we should understand the problem and we should not give up on the problem. I have learned how to create a repository in a git hub ,and how to link the github with the terminal . I have learned that there is a criteria for software engineer that if the problem is solved all the constraints should be met and the solution should be formalised. There are three different types of problem
 
* I have learned that from a hamiltanion path method each node should be attached with a single edge and all the nodes should be connected. In eulers graph theory ,if there is a problem and the problem has no solution that can be explained using eulers theory that the problem has no solution using it. I learned that computer is that it can compute it calculat. I learned about the evolution of computer,that are mechanical, electrical, electronic and quantum.I learned about languages ,every languages has space and punchuations to represent a word and each word has seperate meaning . If there is no space in between the meaning of the word may change ,so that space are used to give a word seperate meaning.More problem solving about the multiplication using algorithm .

# presentation

* The presentation should clear to people who are listening. Presentation can be small but the summary and the key points to present should be clear. Smile and Make Eye Contact with your Audience. start strongly. I have gain more information about the topic. Give more example to make the peoples, who listens to understand the topic. Give a good heading for the topic

# Animation

* I have learned about the history of animation. History of animation started before the development of cinematography.An egyptian jar with graphical image in it , These kinds of arts were the example to be the  first animation .John Barnes Linnett  found kineograph or flip book
*It is a collection of pages ,if we flip the pages the drawn pictures will be of running image. Charles-Émile Reynaud” a self thought engineer created and presented proxinoscope.This proxinoscope were said to be the first animation.Fantasmogarie was the first animated movie, this clip was the first fully made animated movie.

# About program
* If there is a problem or a question it will have constraints. Data is a collection of information.this can be useful for creating algorithm.braces and double braces  are used to represent a string. variable are used to store value. Then i have learned about token iser, lexical analysis,syntactic analysis and sematic analysis.In a computer language these are used to check the lanuage are the given input is correct or error. Token iser is that the given input will break into block. Lexical analysis check that each tokens have a meaning. Syntactic analysis check the syntex and structure of input. Sematic analysis check the meaning of the whole block.
