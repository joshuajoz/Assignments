* Day11

- Today i learned about languages ,every languages has space and punchvations to represent a word and each word has seperate meaning . If there is no space inbetween the meaning of the word may change ,so that space are used to give a word seperate meaning. That is for example,if there is a sentance like "He is nowhere" and "He is now here" both are the same words nowhere and now here thay gives seperate meanings for a single word if the both words are combined then it also gives a meaning but the meaning of the sentance is changed ,so space and punchvations are used. vowels are the letters that gives meaning to a word . Every language has somthing like that in tamil there are 'uyir mei yeluthukal' to give a meaning to a word and to seperate a word.
